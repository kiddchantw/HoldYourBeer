# Loading States Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of loading states within the "HoldYourBeer" application, focusing on providing immediate user feedback during asynchronous operations. The primary technology used for implementing these loading states is Livewire, leveraging its built-in `wire:loading` directives.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Beer Creation Form (`resources/views/livewire/create-beer.blade.php`)
Loading indicators have been implemented for the beer creation form to provide visual feedback when a user submits the form.

**Key elements and Livewire directives used:**
-   **Form Overlay and Spinner:**
    -   A `div` element is positioned absolutely over the form.
    -   It uses `wire:loading.flex wire:target="save"` to display a flex container with a semi-transparent background and a spinning animation (Tailwind CSS `animate-spin`) when the `save` method of the Livewire component is being executed.
    -   A message "Saving beer..." is displayed below the spinner.
-   **Form Field Disabling:**
    -   All input fields (`x-text-input`) within the form have `wire:loading.attr="disabled" wire:target="save"` applied. This automatically disables the input fields while the form is being submitted, preventing further user input during processing.
-   **Submit Button State:**
    -   The primary submit button (`x-primary-button`) also has `wire:loading.attr="disabled" wire:target="save"` to disable it during submission.
    -   The button's text dynamically changes using `<span>` elements with `wire:loading.remove` and `wire:loading` directives. When loading, the text changes from "Save Beer" to "Saving...".

## Future Enhancements
-   Implement loading states for brand search and beer search suggestions.
-   Implement loading states for incrementing beer counts.
-   Implement global page loading indicators for navigation.
-   Enhance error handling feedback with specific loading state transitions.
-   Implement progress indicators for image uploads.
