Feature: User Registration
  In order to access the main application features
  As a new user
  I want to be able to create an account

  Scenario: A new user registers with valid credentials
    Given I am on the registration page
    When I fill in "name" with "John Doe"
    And I fill in "email" with "john.doe@example.com"
    And I fill in "password" with "a_secure_password_123"
    And I fill in "password_confirmation" with "a_secure_password_123"
    And I press the "Register" button
    Then I should be redirected to the "/dashboard" page
    And I should see the welcome message "Welcome, John Doe"

  Scenario: A user tries to register with an existing email
    Given a user with the email "existing.user@example.com" already exists
    When I try to register with the email "existing.user@example.com"
    Then I should see an error message indicating the email is already taken
